Name of Quantlet: XFGTVP_BetaChange

Published in: Applied Quantitative Finance (3rd Edition)

Description: 'Performs quantile LASSO regression in a moving window by using BIC 
and GACV criteria to choose penalty parameter (lambda). The simulated data contains 
a break point after which the parameter beta changes. Plots time series of lambda 
in quantile LASSO regression. Furthermore, the cardinality of the active set q, 
the L2-norm of the residuals and the L1-norm of the parameter beta are plotted. 
All of the plots contain results from a number of simulations and the average over 
all of them.'

Keywords: 'quantile, regression, lasso, L1-norm penalty, lasso shrinkage, L1-constraint, 
cross-validation, time varying, change point, bic, simulation, plot, visualization, 
historical moving window'
