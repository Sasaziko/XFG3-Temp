Name of Quantlet: XFGTVP_LambdaSysRisk

Published in: Applied Quantitative Finance (3rd Edition)

Description: 'Plots time series of average lambda from quantile LASSO regression
computed in XFGTVP_FRM together with systemic risk measures such as the implied volatility 
index reported by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (VIX) and the Standard & Poor"s 500 
stock market index (S&P500) downloaded from Yahoo Finance, CoVaR computed with single 
index model (CoVaR_S) and linear regression model (CoVaR_L) from TENET_SIM 
and TENET_Linear, financial turbulence, the composite indicator of systemic risk (CISS) 
downloaded from ECB Statistical Data Warehouse, the volatility connectedness index (VC) 
obtained from financialconnectedness.org and credit spread and yield slope downloaded 
from Federal Reserve Board. All of the measures including average lambda are normalized 
to interval (0,1).'

Keywords: 'quantile, regression, lasso, L1-norm penalty, lasso shrinkage, L1-constraint, 
cross-validation, time varying, bic, plot, visualization, historical moving window,
